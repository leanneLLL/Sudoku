# Sudoku Game
A single-player puzzle game that allows users to play the classic SUDOKU game on console. 

The objective is to fill a 9*9 grid with digits so that each column and each row contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates. The game setter provides a partially completed grid, and each round of the game has exactly one solution.

The game has four different difficulty levels, and each level comes with 10 distinct board patterns. 


The game was built with C++, Obj-C on Xcode. This game is the final project for my 
[CS250 Introduction to Object Oriented Programming: C++](https://catalog.canadacollege.edu/current/courses/computer-science/cis-250.php) at Ca√±ada College in 2018.
